#About 

GetWeather App is a React.js project which lets you find the weather of any city and give you all the relevant 
weather information in a very good looking responsive(almost all cases) page rather than intimidating you with 
lots of information it only displays the relevant information.

#Technologies Used 

To built the the App I used the create-react-app as base for the app changed the App.js and index.js files with 
my own and also changed the 'App.css' and added 3 more components. Used Bootstrap4.0.0 for responsiveness where 
the grid system and flexbox(both used) came handy as well as the CSS3 media queries helped in positioning the 
content at different screen sizes. Moment.js is anothe rhandy tool used for date & time manipulation.
Following are the tools/lib/frameworks used-  
1.React.js 
2.Moment.js 
3.Bootstrap 4.0.0 
4.JavaScript 
5.CSS3 
6.HTML5

Error handling is also being handled and in case you are not entering in the textbox it will tell you to enter
the city name or enter he city name correctly when the name doesn't matches any API output.

Currently the app shows the current weather of a place and the locale date & time of the location from where you 
are using it. 

#Future Scope

In future I'm planning to use Google maps to get the local timezone, precipitation prediction 
and some more information to be added. A much more interactive UI is also being updated.
