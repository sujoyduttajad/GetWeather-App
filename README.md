#About
GetWeather App is a React.js project which lets you find the weather of any city and give you all the relevant weather information in a very good looking responsive(almost all cases) page rather than intimidating you with lots of information it only displays the relevant information. 

#Technologies Used
To built the the App I used the create-react-app as base for the app changed the App.js and index.js files with my own and also changed the 'App.css' and added 3 more components. Used Bootstrap4.0.0 for responsiveness and Moment.js for date & time manipulation. 
 1.React.js
 2.Moment.js
 3.Bootstrap 4.0.0
 4.JavaScript
 5.CSS3
 6.HTML5
